# Next.js + Tailwind CSS


The frontend of this project is built using Next.js, a popular React framework known for its performance and scalability. It provides features such as server-side rendering and static site generation, which enhance the performance and SEO of the application.

For styling, we've chosen Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that offers low-level utility classes to build custom designs. It promotes component composition and rapid prototyping, making it easier to design and maintain consistent UI across the application.
